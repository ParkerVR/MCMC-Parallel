# Project Title

This project is used for benchmarking a parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This software can be run with GCC, G++, and CUDA, and may work with other compilers. Make sure to select your compiler in the config file.

```
Set COMPILER based on your compiler - 0 for gcc, 1 for g++, 2 for cuda, 3 for any other.
```

## Configuration Options
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
CUDA

## Expectations

Based on tests run, it is expected that x will occur.
